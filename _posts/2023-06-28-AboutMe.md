# About Me

## The Pursuit of Understanding

Welcome to my page! Here, I aim to share valuable pieces of information and things I've learned (TIL) that might be useful for others. I find enjoyment in solving problems, and I'm always willing to lend a helping hand wherever I can. Whether it's offering a simple suggestion like "if it were me, I'd do..." or providing more in-depth assistance, I'm here to contribute to your understanding and growth.

I have a genuine passion for continuous learning, and in the past, I've actively participated in technical forums to assist others. Engaging in such forums not only allowed me to help fellow professionals but also provided me with the opportunity to expand my own knowledge base. Through these interactions, I've gained exposure to various technical stacks and encountered challenges that go beyond my day-to-day work. It is important to note that while I work for a large Cloud provider, the thoughts and opinions shared on this page are solely my own and do not represent the views of my employer.

Everytime I think I understand something it leads me to another rabbit hole!
